# Takeaway skills of Timester 1 on CSP

## Collaboration
- Communication
- Conflict Resolution
- Negotiation
- Github
- Vscode Code
- Merge Conflicts

## Program Function and Purpose
- In Project #1
- I was able to present various forms including texts, images, and audios
- Galley of images, with buttons
- In Project #3
- Our game was meant to be an everyday, interactive game 
- 

## Program Design and Development
- Project Development
- Develop a UI
- Collaborative struggles and improvements
- Source Control - Commit history
- Program documentation - comments on sections of code

## Identifying and Correcting Errors
- Logic errors
- syntax errors
- Debugging 
- Testing different inputs, to achieve the wanted outcome

## Learnings

 > ***Strings and Concatenation:*** The variables n and name are strings. They are concatenated using the + operator, and the string name is repeated 10 times using the * operator.

 > ***Integer Operations:*** Variables n_1 through n_5 represent numbers. Various mathematical operations are performed, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (/), floor division (//), and modulus (%). The modulus result (equation) is compared in a conditional block.

 > ***Dictionaries and Booleans:*** A dictionary named Updated_Profile stores key-value pairs about a person’s profile. The program interacts with the user through input() to check if a hobby is available. The program also checks the length of the string ‘hobbies’ and uses f-strings for formatted output.

 > ***Conditional, Boolean, If/Else:*** A boolean variable (has_socks) is used in an if/else statement. A nested conditional is when there an If/Else inside another If/Else statement.

 > ***Data Structures:*** Lists and tuples are used to store multiple hobbies and favorite hobbies, and their values are printed.
## Process of Sprint 3

First we started of cloning the repos and installing all the tools onto the systems. Then we brainstormed the ideas for our website. After coming up with a functional idea for our website we tried creating a structure that was unique but also suited with everyone else. Then we generated an image, with a guess and explanation box. Then we added cool features that approved your guess. After the we restructured it and added meaningful impacts for the buttons. Then we created a chatroom and kept on refining over time. As time went on, we kept on upgrading the style of the home page of our game and the chatroom. Finally, we added a feature that saved our chat logs, and also added a backend feature. 

## Summary of Trimester 1

>> I had no coding experience prior to joining this class. I was only aware of functions such as the print(). After going watching everyone's presentations and doing their hacks, I was able to strengthen the fundamentals of Python. Now I feel confident in my basic Python Skills, even though I was slighlty informed about Javascript and personally feel like I can still improve in that area. In the process of creating my lesson and my websites, I was able to grasp the foundational python elements of coding. In the lesson and websites I created, I truly educated myself about the topics before teaching my classmates. I created the examples truly simple, just the way I thought I would understand of I was viewer. In the Zoom N Guess game, I was able to apply my knowledge from previous experiences to elevate the style and smoothness of the frontend of our website

## Accomplishments
- I was very proud of the lesson I created (3.1 Python Variables and Assignments)
- My about page
- The tools I obtained over the trimester to perfect the UI of websites
- Presenting to peers and other adults

## Improvements
- Better communicate the ideas of lesson with our teamates to create a cohesive lesson
- Our team as a whole could have been less reliant on AI tools such as ChatGpt, and write the code more by ourself
