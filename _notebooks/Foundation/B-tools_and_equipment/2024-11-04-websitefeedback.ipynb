    "## Summary of Zoom N Guess with a Built-In Chat Room\n",
    "\n",
    "*Zoom N Guess* is an interactive game where players have fun guessing who or what is in a closely zoomed-in image. The main idea of the game is to challenge players’ observation skills and see who can identify the hidden object or person the fastest. Here’s how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gameplay\n",
    "Players are shown a zoomed-in image that makes it hard to tell what or who it is. They have to look closely at details and make educated guesses based on what they see. The goal is to be the first to identify the image correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submitting Guesses\n",
    "Each player types their guess and an explanation for why they think it’s correct. This part helps players practice describing what they observe and explaining their reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-In Chat Room\n",
    "The game includes a chat room where players can talk to each other, share their thoughts, and work together or compete to guess the image. The chat makes the game more interactive and fun, as players can react to each other’s guesses or give hints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Colorful Feedback\n",
    "When a player submits their guess and explanation, it appears in the chat room. To make it more interesting, each player’s messages are shown in a unique color, making it easy to tell who said what. This keeps the chat organized and adds a splash of color to the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game Challenges\n",
    "As players make their guesses, the game can give hints if they’re stuck, or the image can slowly zoom out to reveal more details, making it easier to identify. This feature keeps the game fair and engaging for everyone, even if the image is tricky at first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Educational and Fun\n",
    "While Zoom N Guess is fun, it also helps improve attention to detail, critical thinking, and teamwork. Players learn how to observe carefully, think logically, and communicate effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Zoom N Guess* with a built-in chat room is a great game for having fun with friends, testing your observation skills, and learning to explain what you see. It’s a mix of challenge, creativity, and teamwork that keeps players coming back for more!"
