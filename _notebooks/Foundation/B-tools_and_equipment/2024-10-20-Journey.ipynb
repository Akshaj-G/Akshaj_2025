    "## Journey\n",
    "\n",
    ">> I had no coding experience prior to joining this class. I was only aware of functions such as the print(). After going watching everyone's presentations and doing their hacks, I was able to strengthen the fundamentals of Python. Now I feel confident in my basic Python Skills, even though I was slighlty informed about Javascript and personally feel like I can still improve in that area. In the process of creating my lesson, I was able to grasp the foundational python elements of coding. In the lesson I created, I truly educated myself about the topics before teaching my classmates. I created the examples truly simple, just the way I thought I would understand of I was viewer. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Accomplishments\n",
    "- I was very proud of the lesson I created (3.1 Python Variables and Assignments)\n",
    "- I was also proud the way I presented the lesson, I showcase my understanding surrounding the topics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Improvements\n",
    "- Better communicate the ideas of lesson with our teamates to create a cohesive lesson\n",
    "- Our team as a whole could have been less reliant on AI tools such as ChatGpt, to put forward original material\n",

    "\n",
    " > ***Strings and Concatenation:*** The variables n and name are strings. They are concatenated using the + operator, and the string name is repeated 10 times using the * operator.\n",
    "\n",
    " > ***Integer Operations:*** Variables n_1 through n_5 represent numbers. Various mathematical operations are performed, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (/), floor division (//), and modulus (%). The modulus result (equation) is compared in a conditional block.\n",
    "\n",
    " > ***Dictionaries and Booleans:*** A dictionary named Updated_Profile stores key-value pairs about a person’s profile. The program interacts with the user through input() to check if a hobby is available. The program also checks the length of the string ‘hobbies’ and uses f-strings for formatted output.\n",
    "\n",
    " > ***Conditional, Boolean, If/Else:*** A boolean variable (has_socks) is used in an if/else statement. A nested conditional is when there an If/Else inside another If/Else statement.\n",
    "\n",
    " > ***Data Structures:*** Lists and tuples are used to store multiple hobbies and favorite hobbies, and their values are printed."
