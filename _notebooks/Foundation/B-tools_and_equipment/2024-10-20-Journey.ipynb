    "\n",
    "I had no coding experience prior to joining this class. I was only aware of functions such as the print(). After going watching everyone's presentations and doing their hacks, I was able to strengthen the fundamentals of Python. Now I feel confident in my basic Python Skills, even though I was slighlty informed about Javascript and personally feel like I can still improve in that area. In the process of creating my lesson, I was able to grasp the foundational python elements of coding. In the lesson I created, I truly educated myself about the topics before teaching my classmates. I created the examples truly simple, just the way I thought I would understand of I was viewer. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Accomplishments\n",
    "- I was very proud of the lesson I created (3.1 Python Variables and Assignments)\n",
    "- I was also proud the way I presented the lesson, I showcase my understanding surrounding the topics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Improvements\n",
    "- Better communicate the ideas of lesson with our teamates to create a cohesive lesson\n",
    "- Our team as a whole could have been less reliant on AI tools such as ChatGpt, to put forward original material"
